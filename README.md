Netflix, one of the largest streaming platforms, has a vast library of movies and TV shows, which makes it difficult for users to find the content they are interested in. Clustering similar movies and TV shows based on their attributes such as genre, release year, rating, etc., can be a solution to this problem. This project aims to use unsupervised machine learning algorithms to cluster similar movies and TV shows and provide personalized recommendations to users. The project and CSV file of the dataset are available in the repository.
